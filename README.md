## Poker Hand Strength Evaluator

### Functionality

Solution was written in `JavaScript` using `node.js`.\
`Readline` was imported in order to read data from a readable stream one line at a time.\
Program was written using a `Functional Programming` approach.\
All `three` game types are supported.\
`Error checks` have been added.

### Building and running

To install the needed prequesites run the `./prepare.sh` shell script.\
To run the program with a given txt file run the `./run.sh` shell script with an input file:\
`./run.sh < yourfile.txt`

### Limitations

No tests are written for the application, all testing was done manually.\
Application could have been written in a much more elegant fashion.\
Code could be cleaner.\
Everything is written in one file, but could have been split.\
Probably this was done more complex than it should have been.\
Overall `app.js` file looks difficult to read.\
Also would have been more optimal from my side to use `TypeScript` instead of vanilla `JavaScript`.
