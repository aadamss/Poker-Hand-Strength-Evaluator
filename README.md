## Poker Hand Strength Evaluator

### Functionality

Solution was written in `JavaScript` using `node.js`.\
`Readline` was imported in order to read data from a readable stream one line at a time.\
Program was written using a `Functional Programming` approach.\
All three game types are supported.

### Building and running

Prequesites needed are in the `prepare.sh` shell script.\
Running is inside the `run.sh` shell script.

### Limitations

I did not write any tests for the application, all testing was done manually.\
So the downside is the lack of tests.\
I know that I could have written the application in a much more elegant fashion.\
Code could be cleaner and also I did not split anything.\
Everything is written in one file, but could have been split.\
Probably this was done more complex than it should have been.\
Also would have been more optimal from my side to use `TypeScript` instead of vanilla `JavaScript`.
